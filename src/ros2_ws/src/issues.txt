-- Nishant - Issues found during development of this repo--

Initial spawn explosion (Global issue)
    - robot flies up upon spawning for the first time, afterwards there is normal behaviour
    - has something to do with contact Kp Kd

Executor start problem (LAIR issue)
    - executor sends joint positions 0 0 0 at the start 
    - robot ends up jumping when standing
    - hacked solution: starting high (height) in a way solves it

Moving forward problem (LAIR issue)
    - robot moves backward
    - hacked solution: Using LAIR
    - potential solution: PD gains?

Stability problem (LAIR issue)
    - robot falls off really fast
    - hacked solution: reduced robot from 0.34 to 0.28

Wrong/Inconsistent signs for sleep position b/w LAIR and SVAN (LAIR issue)
    - FR and FL abd values are negated

Executor sleep problem (LAIR issue)
    - checks body x y z values?
    - potentially wrong because of inconsistent signs

URDF to Xacro (Global issue)
    - will have to check
    - xacro_run works but there were issues with the xacro from sim_release (the one containing camera mount)
    - sim_release xacro file is in repo svan_sw

Joint trajectory messages (LAIR issue)
    - time from start - 0 s 0 ns (no other combinations seem to work)
    - header empty (sending timestamp doesn't seem to help at all)
    - this issue would not necessarily solve any problem but will clariify why we cannot use joint messages with delays

Figure out why CHAMP works with only P commands and PD, and why LAIR does not work (LAIR issue)
    - work with Rudradeep/Jagdeesh

Generate/Use consistent worlds for mapping and nav testing
    - can use the MAP used by CHAMP/TB3
    
Odometry 
    - Currently using direct odometry would be better to use the odometry provided by legged odometry instead as it is more practical

Stability 
    - Due to instability while moving some portions get unmarked
