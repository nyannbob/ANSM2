Initial spawn explosion 
    - robot flies up upon spawning for the first time, afterwards there is normal behaviour
    - has something to do with contact Kp Kd

Executor start problem 
    - executor sends joint positions 0 0 0 at the start 
    - robot ends up jumping when standing
    - hacked solution: starting high (height) in a way solves it

Moving forward problem
    - robot moves backward
    - hacked solution: Using LAIR
    - potential solution: PD gains?

Stability problem
    - robot falls off really fast
    - hacked solution: reduced robot from 0.34 to 0.28

Wrong/Inconsistent signs for sleep position b/w LAIR and SVAN (ROS2)
    - FR and FL abd values are negated

Executor sleep problem
    - checks body x y z values?
    - potentially wrong because of inconsistent signs

URDF to Xacro
    - will have to check

Joint trajectory messages
    - time from start - 0 s 0 ns (no other combinations seem to work)
    - header empty (sending timestamp doesn't seem to help at all)

Figure out why CHAMP works with only P commands and PD, and why LAIR does not work
    - work with Rudradeep

Use champ world

URDF-to-Xacro
    - PascalCase vs snake_case
    

Launch (python) file XML read issue (possible solution - URDF to xacro)
Control configuration direct path in description (possible solution - URDF to xacro)
